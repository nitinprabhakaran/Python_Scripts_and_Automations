I have been dealing with kidney-related ailments for the past two years. Until March 2024, these conditions were manageable. However, recent in-depth analysis, including a kidney biopsy, revealed the root cause of my issues. Based on my doctor's recommendations, I must follow strict dietary regulations, such as eliminating salt and fat from my diet. These restrictions are necessary while I am on a steroid treatment to aid in recovery and minimize side effects. The dietary changes are also intended to prevent the development of other conditions, such as diabetes, during this treatment period.
